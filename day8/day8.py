# PART 2 IDEA:
	if length 2 -> save the characters for the 1

	if length 3 -> it's a 7

	if length 4 -> it's a 4

	if length 7 -> it's an 8

	if length 5 ->
		-> if has character for the 1 -> its a 3

	if length 6 ->
		-> doesnt have characters for the 1 -> its a 6
		-> else if doesnt have characters for the 3 -> it's a 0
		-> else -> it's a 9
		-> save the letter that isn't in 9 but is in 6 for later use
	
	if length 5 ->
		-> if has letter from 6 and not 9 -> it's a 2
		-> otherwise it's a 5
	
# TEST:
	input:
		be cfbegad cbdgef fgaecd cgeb fdcge agebfd fecdb fabcd edb

		be -> length 2 -> 1
		edb -> length 3 -> 7
		cgeb -> length 4 -> 4
		cfbegad -> length 7 -> 8

		fecdb -> has character for 1 -> 3

		fgaecd -> doesnt have characters for the 1 -> 6
		agebfd -> doesnt have characters for the 3 -> 0
		cbdgef -> remaining -> 9

		letter that is in 6 but not in 9 -> a

		fdcge -> doesnt have a letter that is in 6 and not in 9 -> 5
		fabcd -> remaining -> 2

		right side output:
		fdgacbe cefdb cefbgd gcbe
		8		3	  9		 4
